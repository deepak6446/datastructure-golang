Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.


/*
*  keep track of max index that can be reached from current index 
* if at any point current index passes max index that can be reached then max index can never be reached.
*/
```javascript
func canJump(nums []int) bool {
    maxReach:=0
    for currIndex:=0;currIndex<len(nums);currIndex++ {
        currJump:=nums[currIndex]
        if currIndex > maxReach {
            return false
        }
        
        if currJump+currIndex > maxReach {
            maxReach = currJump+currIndex
        }
    }
    return true
    
}
```javascript
